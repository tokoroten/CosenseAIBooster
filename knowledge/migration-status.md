# Migration Status

## Completed
- Created migration plan
- Evaluated migration complexity
- Created detailed migration guide
- Identified key differences between Webpack and WXT project structures
- Tested basic WXT configuration

## Analysis
After thorough investigation, we've determined that a direct automated migration from Webpack to WXT is challenging due to structural differences. The recommended approach is to create a new WXT project and migrate components one by one.

## Recommendation
1. Create a new WXT project with React template
2. Migrate components, state management, and utilities one by one
3. Update imports and paths to match the new structure
4. Test each component after migration

## Benefits of the Recommended Approach
- Cleaner codebase
- Better development experience
- Modern build system
- Reduced technical debt
- Eliminates incompatibilities between old and new structure

## Next Steps
- Follow the migration guide in `wxt-migration-guide.md`
- Create the new project structure
- Migrate components one by one
