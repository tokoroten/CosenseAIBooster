# CosenseAIBooster Migration Summary

## Overview
We've evaluated migrating the CosenseAIBooster Chrome extension from Webpack to WXT (WebExtension Tools) with Vite. This document summarizes our findings and recommendations.

## Key Findings
1. Direct migration is challenging due to structural differences between Webpack and WXT projects
2. The project already uses modern technologies like React, TypeScript, and Zustand
3. WXT provides significant benefits for extension development compared to Webpack

## Benefits of Migration to WXT
1. **Simplified Development Experience**:
   - Hot Module Replacement for quick development
   - Automatic rebuilding on file changes
   - Better error reporting

2. **Improved Build System**:
   - Faster builds with Vite
   - Optimized output for better performance
   - Tree-shaking to reduce bundle size

3. **Modern Architecture**:
   - Cleaner project structure
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Enhanced type safety

4. **Reduced Technical Complexity**:
   - Less configuration code
   - Streamlined development workflow
   - Easier to maintain

## Recommended Migration Path
We recommend a gradual migration approach:

1. Create a new project using the WXT React template
2. Migrate components and functionality one by one
3. Test each component after migration
4. Replace the old project with the new one once complete

## Documentation
We've created detailed documentation to assist with the migration:
- `wxt-migration-guide.md`: Step-by-step migration instructions
- `wxt-project-structure.md`: Reference for WXT project structure
- `migration-status.md`: Current status of the migration effort

## Next Steps
1. Create a new WXT project following the migration guide
2. Migrate the core functionality first (background script, content script)
3. Migrate the UI components (options page, popup)
4. Test thoroughly before releasing

## Timeline
The complete migration is estimated to take 2-4 hours of development time, depending on familiarity with the codebase.
